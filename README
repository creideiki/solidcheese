Solid Cheese, the extremely short documentation.

To build the Doxygen documentation, install Doxygen
(<URL:http://www.doxygen.org/> and run "make doc".

HTML documentation ends up in doc/html/index.html.

Read modeler_constants.h for the list of useable command keys in the
modeler.

There are a few test models (mostly cheese) in the test/
directory. Note that they are *large* - an Athlon64 3200+ with a
GeForce FX 5900XT gets about 5 FPS on cheese-50.scs (53 primitives)
when built in release mode.
