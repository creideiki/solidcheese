Solid Cheese, the extremely short documentation.

Read rapport/rapport.lyx for more information (in Swedish).

This is a constructive solid geometry modeler and renderer, using
Nigel Stewart's sequenced convex subtraction algorithm
(<http://www.nigels.com/research/>), built as a university lab project
in computer graphics in 2003.

To build the programs, run "make". Requires a C++ compiler and OpenGL
development libraries.

To look at something pretty, run "./solidcheese", press "l" to load a
model and type the file name "test/cheese-50.scs".

In the modeler, right mouse button rotates the camera and left mouse
button moves the primitive under the cursor. Switch renderer debug
modes using the numbers keys 1-4.

To build the Doxygen documentation, install Doxygen
(<URL:http://www.doxygen.org/> and run "make doc".

HTML documentation ends up in doc/html/index.html.

Read modeler_constants.h for the list of useable command keys in the
modeler.

There are a few test models (mostly cheese) in the test/
directory. Note that they are *large* - an Athlon64 3200+ with a
GeForce FX 5900XT gets about 5 FPS on cheese-50.scs (53 primitives)
when built in release mode.
