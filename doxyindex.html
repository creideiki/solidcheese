 * \mainpage Solid Cheese
 *
 * \section whatis What is Solid Cheese?
 *
 * Solid Cheese is a simple CSG (Constructive Solid Geometry) modeler and
 * renderer, using the <a href="http://www.nigels.com/research/">SCS</a>
 * (Sequenced Convex Subtraction) algorithm with the linear-time intersection
 * addition. The name comes from the fact that one of the standard CSG demos
 * (when a hollow pipe just isn't complex enough) is a Swiss cheese. 
 *
 * \section usage How do I use it?
 *
 * -# Download the source. Since you don't have CVS access, get a snapshot from
 *    <a href="http://creideiki.cjb.net/computers/computers.shtml">
 *    http://creideiki.cjb.net/computers/computers.shtml</a>.
 * -# Build the source. You'll probably need to tweak the makefile a bit, since
 *    there don't seem to exist two systems that do OpenGL in the same way.
 *    The makefile includes tweaks for the systems we have built it on:
 *    - Solaris 8
 *    - Gentoo Linux
 *    - Windows XP SP1 + MinGW
 *    .
 *    Pre-defined targets:
 *    <dl><dt><tt>all</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds everything in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>clean</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Removes everything but the source.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>solidcheese</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds the main executable in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>interface_test</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds the dummy modeler and the dummy renderer in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>matrix_test</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds some tests for the matrix code in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>modeler_test</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds the real modeler and the dummy renderer in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>renderer_test</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds the dummy modeler and the real renderer in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>normalize_test</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds some tests for the tree normalizer in debug mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>glinfo</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds a program that gives you information about your OpenGL
 *            implementation.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>doc</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds the automated documentation (what you're reading now).
 *            Requires Doxygen.</dd></dl>
 *    If you have at least GNU Make 3.77, you can also use
 *    <dl><dt><tt>release</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds everything in release mode.</dd>
 *        <dt><tt>debug</tt></dt>
 *        <dd>Builds everything in debug mode.</dd></dl>
 *    To build in release mode without GNU Make 3.77, edit the CXXFLAGS variable as
 *    indicated in the <tt>release</tt> target. Note that a "make clean" is necessary
 *    whenever you switch between release and debug mode.
 *
 * -# Run <tt>solidcheese</tt>, or whatever you chose to build.
 * -# Use it.
 *    - <tt>renderer_test</tt> and <tt>interface_test</tt> has only one control - to
 *      rotate the model, press space.
 *    - In <tt>solidcheese</tt> and <tt>modeler_test</tt> you can rotate the model freely
 *      by holding the right mouse button. You can also move objects in the plane
 *      perpendicular to the screen containing the point the camera is looking at by
 *      dragging them with the left mouse button.

 *
 * \section administrivia Who wrote it?
 *
 * Solid Cheese was written by Simon Elén, Marcus Eriksson, Karl-Johan Karlsson,
 * and Nils Öster, students at the Computer Science program at
 * <a href="http://www.liu.se/">Linköping University</a>, as a project in
 * <a href="http://www.isy.liu.se/~ingis/TSEA55.html">TSEA55 Computer
 * Graphics</a> in the spring of 2003. It is released under the
 * <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU GPL license</a>.
 *
 * \section seealso What do I need to read to understand this?
 *
 * <a href="http://www.nigels.com/research/">Nigel Stewart's research page</a>
 * has, in PDF format, all the research documents we used:<ul>
 * <li>N. Stewart, G. Leach, S. John: "An improved  z-buffer CSG rendering
 * algorithm". <i>1998 Eurographics/Siggraph workshop on graphics hardware</i>,
 * pp. 25-30, Aug 1998.</li>
 * <li>N. Stewart, G. Leach, S. John: "A z-buffer CSG rendering algorithm for
 * convex objects". <i>The 8:th international conference in central Europe on
 * computer graphics, visualisation and interactive digital media '2000 -
 * WSCG 2000</i>, vol. II, pp. 369-372, Feb 2000.</li>

 * elements of S<sub>n</sub> by decimation". <i>Discrete mathematics and
 * theoretical computer science</i>, proceedings vol. AA (2001), pp. 165-176.</li>

 * convex objects". <i>The 10:th international conference in central Europe on
 * computer graphics, visualisation and computer vision '2002 -
 * WSCG 2002</i>, vol. II, pp. 437-444, Feb 2002.</li></ul>
 * For the implementation, 3Dlabs has a good
 * <a href="http://www.3dlabs.com/support/developer/glmanpage_index.htm">reference</a>
 * to OpenGL.
 *
 * \section bugs It doesn't work!
 *
 * The development environments, while varied, have all used the GNU toolchain with
 * GCC 3.x compilers. No tests have been made with other toolchains. If you try,
 * you are on your own.
 *
 * If the image is split in two halves and/or everything looks light blue, you are
 * most likely linking to an old version of the OpenGL libraries. See comment in the
 * makefile.
 *
 * If <tt>modeler_test</tt> looks good but <tt>solidcheese</tt> gives black blobs in
 * strange places, try increasing the #OPENGL_BUGGINESS constant in renderer.cpp.
 *
 * \section links Where can I get the latest version?
 *
 * Anonymous CVS access is, unfortunately, not possible at this moment. You may browse
 * the repository with CVSweb at
 * <a href="http://creideiki.cjb.net/cgi-bin/cvsweb/cvsweb.cgi/solidcheese/">
